This plugin will add the first image from your post to your RSS feed.

== Description ==

This plugin will add the first image from the current post to your RSS feed. This way, your feed should have an image for every post, which will make your RSS easier & more fun to read (Mashable & LifeHacker for example use this technique).

If your post doesn't have an image, you can specify a default image to insert. Next version will have rotating default images. You can also set options for the excerpt length, what tags to strip, customize the "Read more.." link and more!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `rss-image-in-post` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through your `Plugins` menu in WordPress.
3. Under `Settings`, visit `RSS Post Images` to change settings.

== Screenshots ==

1. The thumbnails are now showing up in the feed: screenshot.png
